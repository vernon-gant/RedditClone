# Spring Boot Reddit Clone

This is an educative project for a Reddit clone built using Spring Boot 2 and Spring Framework 5, developed alongside a Udemy course. While following the course, I experimented with the project to deepen my understanding and enhance my skills.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Gained knowledge of core Spring concepts like Beans, IoC, and Dependency Injection.
2. Explored features of Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Thymeleaf.
3. Experienced MVC pattern in action.

## Built With

* [Spring Boot 2](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
* [Spring Framework 5](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/)
* [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)
* [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
* [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/)

## Project Status

The project is not complete, as I stopped before implementing Spring Security. It turns out that learning Spring Security is a whole new adventure in itself - almost like undertaking another project! ðŸ˜„

Regardless, this project has significantly boosted my Java skills and provided me with valuable hands-on experience using the Spring framework and the MVC pattern.
